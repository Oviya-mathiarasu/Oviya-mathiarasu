              "[Document(page_content=\"Biography of MS Dhoni For UPSC\\n\\nMahendra Singh Dhoni, popularly known as 'Mahi', is one of the most Internationally acclaimed cricket players and former captain of the Indian Cricket team. A skilled batsman, efficient captain, and flexible wicketkeeper, he played dynamic roles within the team that eventually led India to win the Twenty20 World title. A right-handed batsman and wicketkeeper, he is also one of the top finishers in the limited-over format. He delivered incredible performances throughout his career, soaring the legacy of cricket in India.\\n\\nRead more articles and biographies for UPSC 2023 to ace your preparation.\\n\\nEarly Life\\n\\nMahendra Singh Dhoni was born in the Ranchi district of Jharkhand on 7 July 1981. He was the youngest of the three children of Pan Singh and Devaki Devi. His family belonged to Hindu Rajputs and was based in the Langara block of the Almora district in Uttarakhand.\\n\\nDuring his schooling at DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir, he was interested in football and badminton and was the goalkeeper of the football team. Gradually, he got inspired by his coach Keshav Ranjan Banerjee to play cricket for the school team. His exceptional talent in wicketkeeping made him a consistent player for Commando Cricket Club during the period of 1995-1998. He also played for the Vinoo Mankad Trophy Under - 16 championship during 1997-1998 and gave a notable performance.\\n\\nHe worked as a Travelling Ticket Examiner(TTE) at the Kharagpur Railway station under the\\n\\nSouth Eastern Railway from 2001 - 2003.\\n\\nCareer in Cricket\\n\\nIn 1998, Dhoni started his official career in cricket with Central Coalfields Limited (CCL)Team.\\n\\nHis performance helped the team reach the A division. Deval Sahay, a former Vice President of the Bihar Cricket Association, was impressed by his performance and recommended him to the Bihar team. Dhoni started playing with the Ranchi team, the junior Bihar team, and finally with the Senior team from Bihar for the Ranji trophy.\\n\\nHe played for under - 19 Bihar team in Cooch Behar Trophy(1999-2000) and scored well. He\\n\\nalso played for the CK Nayudu Trophy in the same year for the East Zone U-19 squad.\\n\\nRanji Trophy\\n\\nIn 1999-2000, Dhoni made his debut for the Ranji trophy at the age of 18. He scored a\\n\\nhalf-century in the first match against Assam. He gave a satisfactory performance, scoring 283 runs in 5 matches. He scored his first century in the 2000-2001 season against Bengal, playing for the Bihar team. Apart from that, he did not give a noteworthy performance in the season.\\n\\nJharkhand Team\\n\\nIn the 2002- 2023 season, Dhoni managed to score three half-centuries in the Ranji Trophy, and a couple of half-centuries in the Deodhar Trophy. Following this, his hard-hitting style in batting and lower-order contribution started gaining recognition in the cricket circle.\\n\\nIn the 2003-2004 season, he further improved his performance, scoring a century in the first Ranji ODI tournament against Assam. Dhoni was a part of the East Zone team that won the Deodhar Trophy in 2003-2004. His overall contribution was 244 runs from 4 matches against the Central zone. He again played for the East Zone for the Duleep Trophy finals and scored a half-century in the second innings.\\n\\n\\n\\nFinally, Dhoni’s performance garnered the attention of the Talent Resource Development Wing (TRDW), an initiative by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to spot small-town talent. Prakash Poddar, a Talent Resource Development Officer, noticed Dhoni’s performance in Jamshedpur in 2003 for the Jharkhand team. He sent a report to the National Cricket Academy, referring to his talent.\\n\\nIndia- A team\\n\\nHe was chosen to be a part of India - A team, the second tier of International Cricket from India, owing to his exceptional performances in the 2003-2004 season. He got selected for India - A squad tour of Kenya and Zimbabwe. He delivered the best performance in wicketkeeping and stumping in the match against Zimbabwe. Also, he pulled off a notable performance in the tri-nation tournament of India - A team with Kenya and Pakistan - A team.\\n\\nHe maintained consistency, delivering remarkable performances, including a few centuries in the series with an average of 362 runs in 6 innings. Thus, he got noticed by Ravi Shastri and Saurav Ganguly, the then-captain of the Indian Cricket team.\\n\\nBeginning of International Career\\n\\nDhoni started his International career against Bangladesh (ODI squad) in 2004-2005. Though he had a cold start in the series, he was chosen for the ODI series against Pakistan. Dhoni set the record for achieving the highest score by an Indian wicketkeeper in his fifth one-day international at Visakhapatnam. He got batting opportunities for two games in the bilateral ODI series against Srilanka. He also set the record for scoring the highest individual score in ODI\\n\\ncricket innings with the highest run aggregate of 346. He also received the title ‘Man of the Series' for his incredible performance in the series.BCCI rewarded him with a B-grade contract in December 2005.\\n\\nDhoni played with his full potential in the series against Pakistan in 2006, scoring 149 runs in\\n\\ntwo matches. As a result of his sterling performances throughout the ODI series, Dhoni topped the ICC ODI rankings for batsmen in 2006. He replaced Ricky Ponting and became the fastest batsman to achieve that in just 42 innings. However, he did not deliver a satisfactory performance in the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy and ODI series in South Africa. He indeed received criticism for his wicket-keeping technique from Syed Kirmani, a former Indian wicketkeeper. However, he was listed in the World ODI XI by the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2016 for his remarkable efforts.\\n\\nPrior to the 2007 World Cup, Dhoni scored an average of more than 100 in series against West Indies and Sri Lanka. India crashed out of the World Cup following the defeat to Bangladesh, and Dhoni did not contribute as well. He was back on track by bagging the ‘Man of the Match title in his fourth ODI cricket match against Bangladesh. He also got selected as the 'Man of the series for the same.\\n\\nHis position in the Indian cricket team got elevated as he got selected to play the role of\\n\\nvice-captain of the ODI team for the series against South Africa and the India-England Seven match ODI series. Along with that, his ‘B’ grade contract with BCCI got upgraded to an ‘A’ grade contract in 2007. In September 2007, he got selected as the Captain of the Indian Cricket team for the World Twenty20. In the same year, he crossed Adam Gilchrist’s record of maximum dismissals in an innings by catching five English players and stumping one.\\n\\nOn September 30, 2009, Dhoni took his first and only wicket during his career, bowling Tarvis Drowlin of West Indies, during the ICC Champions Trophy. During the course of 2009, Dhoni maintained his form in batting and topped the ICC ODI rankings for the batsman. Michael Hussey of Australia replaced him at the beginning of next year.\\n\\nCaptain of the Indian Team\\n\\nHis career was at a peak throughout the year 2009. With a score of a total of 1198 runs in 24 innings and a high average score of 70.49 in ODIs, he raised his career graph in 2019. Along with that, he was selected as the captain and wicketkeeper of the World ODI XI by the ICC in the same year. He was also the top scorer in ODI’s in 2009, along with Australian player, Ricky Ponting.\\n\\nIn 2012, India played a three-match ODI with Pakistan, where Dhoni top scored for the entire\\n\\nthree innings. Though India had lost the series, his performance and partnership with Ravichandran Ashwin were appreciated.\\n\\nWinning the ICC Champions Trophy in 2013, Dhoni became the only captain in International Cricket to receive all ICC trophies. Even though he only managed to score 27 runs from two innings, his strategies and field placements played an important role in the victory of India. The International Cricket Council (ICC) named him as wicket keeper and captain of the 'Team of the Tournament.\\n\\nFollowing the victory of the Indian team in the Champions Trophy, India played a tri-nation\\n\\ncricket tournament against West Indies and Sri Lanka. Dhoni got injured and was unable to play in the initial matches. But, in the final match against Sri Lanka, he led India to victory. Scoring 52 runs from 45 balls, he was selected as the ‘Man of the Match. Thus, MS Dhoni became the second cricketer in India, after Sachin Tendulkar, to score 1000 or more ODI runs against Australia, in November 2013.\\n\\nDhoni became the first captain of the Indian team to win all group-stage matches during the\\n\\n2015 World Cup in New Zealand. He made a partnership of 186 runs along with Suresh Raina and thus became the highest-scoring Indian captain in New Zealand. Following the defeat of Bangladesh by India, he became the third captain of any cricket team to win 100 ODI matches and the first non-Australian captain to achieve that success. In the 2015 World Cup, he achieved a score of 237 runs in 6 innings with an average of 59.5. He became the second Indian captain to score an average of over 50.\\n\\nTest Matches\\n\\nDhoni scored his first half-century in a test match against Sri Lanka. However, Dhoni scored his maiden century against Pakistan in Faisalabad in 2006. He demonstrated an aggressive batting style that made it possible to achieve the century in 93 balls. Dhoni’s wicket-keeping skills got improved during the test series against West Indies in 2006. He managed 13 catches and 4 stumpings from the entire series. Dhoni led the Indian team to victory in the Sri Lankan tour in 2009 by scoring two centuries. The Indian team ascended to the first position in the Test Cricket rankings for the first time in history.\\n\\nDhoni played the last test series of his career in 2014-2015 against Australia. Under his\\n\\ncaptaincy, India lost the first and second tests. Following that, Dhoni announced his retirement in the third test match. He finished his last test match with nine dismissals and a record of maximum stumpings. Thus, he became the first wicketkeeper of the Indian cricket team to have maximum dismissals. But, the record was broken by Wriddhiman Saha in 2018. He ended his last innings with 24 runs.\\n\\nTwenty20\\n\\nDhoni led the Indian team for the first T-20 World match in 2007. On 24th September, under his captainship India won the ICC T-20 World Cup trophy in South Africa, beating Pakistan. After the iconic victory of the Indian team under Kapil Dev in 1983, Mahendra Singh Dhoni became\\n\\nthe second captain of the Indian cricket team to have won any form of World Cup. Dhoni was given the title of wicket keeper and captain of the 'Team of the Tournament for the 2014 T20 World Cup by the International Cricket Council.\\n\\nDhoni retired from International cricket on August 15, Independence day of 2020.\\n\\nIndian Premier League\\n\\nDhoni became a part of the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) as the most expensive player of the season during the auctions. He was given a copious amount of US$1.5 million. Under his captaincy, Chennai Super Kings gave a laudable performance in the Indian Premier League, bagging the title for 2010,2011,2018, and 2021. Chennai Super Kings also won the Champions League T-20 title in 2010 and 2014. In total, he played 200 T-20 matches for Chennai Super Kings.\\n\\nDhoni is one of the players with a record of playing the maximum number of IPL matches. He\\n\\nalso played as a batsman and wicket-keeper under the captaincy of Steve Smith. After returning to the captaincy in 2018, he continued till 2022. Dhoni stepped down from the post of captain on 24th March 2022 and handed over it to Ravindra Jadeja.\\n\\nPersonal Life\\n\\nOn 4th July 2010, he got married to Sakshi Singh Rawat. The couple has a daughter named\\n\\nZiva.\\n\\nDhoni is the Vice-President of India Cements Ltd, owned by N.Srinivasan, the former Vice\\n\\nPresident of BCCI and owner of Chennai Super Kings.\\n\\nHe is a co-owner of the Indian Conglomerate, Sahara India Pariwar, Ranchi Rays, a hockey\\n\\nclub based in Ranchi, and Chennaiyin FC, a Chennai-based football club, which is a franchise of the Indian Super League (ISL).\\n\\nDhoni owns a lifestyle brand called “SEVEN”, and he is the brand ambassador of the same.\\n\\nAssociation with Territorial Army\\n\\nHe was awarded the honorary rank of Lieutenant Colonel in the Parachute Regiment of the\\n\\nIndian Territorial Army(ITA) in 2011, for his contribution to the nation as a cricket player. At the Agra Training Camp, he completed five parachute training jumps from the aircraft of the Indian Army and became a qualified paratrooper in 2015.\\n\\nAwards and Honours\\n\\nMS Dhoni received Padma Bhushan, the third highest Civilian honour in India, in 2018.\\n\\nIn the year of 2009, he received the fourth-highest civilian award in India, Padma Shri.\\n\\nHe received the highest sporting honour in the country, Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna, in\\n\\n2007-2008.\\n\\nIn 2008 and 2009, he was selected as the ODI player of the year.\\n\\nHe was chosen the Castrol Indian cricketer of the year in 2011.\\n\\nDhoni’s life story was made into a film, ‘M.S.Dhoni: The Untold Story' in 2016.\\n\\nThroughout his career, Dhoni received praise for his ability to handle pressure during tough\\n\\nmatches,wicket-keeping skills, immediate decision-making skills, batting skills, patriotism, etc.\\n\\nFrequently Asked Questions about Mahendra Singh Dhoni\\n\\nWhen did MS Dhoni join the Indian team?\\n\\nMS Dhoni joined India- A Team for the first time for the 2003-2004 season for a Zimbabwe-Kenya tour.

For other uses, see\\xa0Floral (disambiguation).\\n\\nA\\xa0flower, also known as a\\xa0bloom\\xa0or\\xa0blossom, is the reproductive structure found in\\xa0flowering plants\\xa0(plants of the division\\xa0Angiospermae). Flowers consist of a combination of vegetative organs –\\xa0sepals\\xa0that enclose and protect the developing flower, petals that attract pollinators, and reproductive organs that produce\\xa0gametophytes, which in flowering plants produce\\xa0gametes. The male gametophytes, which produce sperm, are enclosed within pollen grains produced in the\\xa0anthers. The female gametophytes are contained within the\\xa0ovules\\xa0produced in the\\xa0carpels.\\n\\nMost flowering plants depend on animals, such as\\xa0bees,\\xa0moths, and\\xa0butterflies, to transfer their pollen between different flowers, and have evolved to attract these\\xa0pollinators\\xa0by various strategies, including brightly colored, conspicuous petals, attractive scents, and the production of\\xa0nectar, a food source for pollinators.[1]\\xa0In this way, many flowering plants have\\xa0co-evolved\\xa0with pollinators to be mutually dependent on services they provide to one another—in the plant\\'s case, a means of reproduction; in the pollinator\\'s case, a source of food.[2]\\n\\nWhen\\xa0pollen\\xa0from the\\xa0anther\\xa0of a flower is deposited on the\\xa0stigma, this is called\\xa0pollination. Some flowers may\\xa0self-pollinate, producing seed using pollen from a different flower of the same plant, but others have mechanisms to prevent self-pollination and rely on\\xa0cross-pollination, when pollen is transferred from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on a different individual of the same\\xa0species. Self-pollination happens in flowers where \\n\\n\\n\\nthe\\xa0stamen\\xa0and\\xa0carpel\\xa0mature at the same time, and are positioned so that the pollen can land on the flower\\'s stigma. This pollination does not require an investment from the plant to provide nectar and pollen as food for pollinators.[3]\\xa0Some flowers produce\\xa0diaspores\\xa0without fertilization (parthenocarpy). After fertilization, the\\xa0ovary\\xa0of the flower develops into\\xa0fruit\\xa0containing\\xa0seeds.\\n\\nFlowers have long been appreciated by humans for their beauty and pleasant scents, and also hold cultural significance as religious, ritual, or symbolic objects, or sources of\\xa0medicine\\xa0and\\xa0food.\\n\\nEtymology\\n\\nFlower is from the\\xa0Middle English\\xa0flour, which referred to both the\\xa0ground grain\\xa0and the reproductive structure in plants, before splitting off in the 17th century. It comes originally from the\\xa0Latin\\xa0name of the Italian goddess of flowers,\\xa0Flora. The early word for flower in English was\\xa0blossom,[4]\\xa0though it now refers to flowers only of\\xa0fruit trees.[5]\\n\\nMorphology\\n\\nDiagram of flower parts.\\n\\nMain article:\\xa0Floral morphology\\n\\nThe\\xa0morphology\\xa0of a flower, or its form and structure,[6]\\xa0can be considered in two parts: the vegetative part, consisting of non-reproductive structures such as\\xa0petals; and the reproductive or sexual parts. A stereotypical flower is made up of four kinds of structures attached to the tip of a short stalk or axis, called a\\xa0receptacle. Each of these parts or floral organs is arranged in a spiral called a\\xa0whorl.[7]\\xa0The four main whorls (starting from the base of the flower or lowest node and working upwards) are the\\xa0calyx,\\xa0corolla,\\xa0androecium, and\\xa0gynoecium. Together the calyx and corolla make up the non-reproductive part of the flower called the\\xa0perianth, and in some cases may not be differentiated. If this is the case, then they are described as\\xa0tepals.[8]\\n\\nPerianth\\n\\nMain article:\\xa0Perianth\\n\\nCalyx\\n\\nThe\\xa0sepals, collectively called the calyx, are modified\\xa0leaves\\xa0that occur on the outermost whorl of the flower. They are leaf-like, in that they have a broad base,\\xa0stomata\\xa0and\\xa0chlorophyll[9]\\xa0and may have\\xa0stipules. Sepals are often waxy and tough, and grow quickly to protect the flower as it develops.[9][10]\\xa0They may \\n\\n\\n\\nbe\\xa0deciduous, but will more commonly grow on to assist in fruit dispersal. If the calyx is fused together it is called gamosepalous.[9]\\n\\nCorolla\\n\\nThe\\xa0petals, together the corolla, are almost or completely fiberless leaf-like structures that form the innermost whorl of the perianth. They are often delicate and thin, and are usually coloured, shaped, or scented to encourage pollination.[11]\\xa0Although similar to leaves in shape, they are more comparable to stamens in that they form almost simultaneously with one another, but their subsequent growth is delayed. If the corolla is fused together it is called sympetalous.[12]\\n\\nReproductive\\n\\nMain article:\\xa0Plant reproductive morphology\\n\\nReproductive parts of Easter Lily (Lilium longiflorum). 1.\\xa0Stigma, 2.\\xa0Style, 3.\\xa0Stamens, 4.\\xa0Filament, 5.\\xa0Petal\\n\\nAndroecium\\n\\nThe\\xa0androecium, or stamens, is the whorl of pollen-producing male parts. Stamens consist typically of an anther, made up of four pollen sacs arranged in two\\xa0thecae, connected to a filament, or stalk. The anther contains microsporocytes which become\\xa0pollen, the male\\xa0gametophyte, after undergoing\\xa0meiosis. Although they exhibit the widest variation among floral organs, the androecium is usually confined just to one whorl and to two whorls only in rare cases. Stamens range in number, size, shape, orientation, and in their point of connection to the flower.[11][12]\\n\\nIn general, there is only one type of stamen, but there are plant species where the flowers have two types; a \"normal\" one and one with anthers that produce sterile pollen meant to attract pollinators.[13]\\n\\nGynoecium\\n\\nThe\\xa0gynoecium, or the carpels, is the female part of the flower found on the innermost whorl. Each carpel consists of a\\xa0stigma, which receives pollen, a style, which acts as a stalk, and an\\xa0ovary, which contains the ovules. Carpels may occur in \\n\\n\\n\\none to several whorls, and when fused are often described as a pistil. Inside the ovary, the\\xa0ovules\\xa0are attached to the\\xa0placenta\\xa0by structures called\\xa0funiculi.[14][15]\\n\\nVariation\\n\\nAlthough this arrangement is considered \"typical\", plant species show a wide variation in floral structure.[16]\\xa0The four main parts of a flower are generally defined by their positions on the receptacle and not by their function. Many flowers lack some parts or parts may be modified into other functions or look like what is typically another part.[17]\\xa0In some families, such as the\\xa0grasses, the petals are greatly reduced; in many species, the sepals are colorful and petal-like. Other flowers have modified stamens that are petal-like; the double flowers of\\xa0Peonies\\xa0and\\xa0Roses\\xa0are mostly petaloid stamens.[18]\\n\\nMany flowers have\\xa0symmetry. When the\\xa0perianth\\xa0is bisected through the central axis from any point and symmetrical halves are produced, the flower is said to be\\xa0actinomorphic\\xa0or regular. This is an example of\\xa0radial symmetry. When flowers are bisected and produce only one line that produces symmetrical halves, the flower is said to be irregular or\\xa0zygomorphic. If, in rare cases, they have no symmetry at all they are called asymmetric.[19][20]\\n\\nFlowers may be directly attached to the plant at their base (sessile—the supporting stalk or stem is highly reduced or absent).[21]\\xa0The stem or stalk subtending a flower, or an\\xa0inflorescence\\xa0of flowers, is called a\\xa0peduncle. If a peduncle supports more than one flower, the stems connecting each flower to the main axis are called\\xa0pedicels.[22]\\xa0The apex of a flowering stem forms a terminal swelling which is called the torus or receptacle.[20]\\n\\nIn the majority of species, individual flowers have both\\xa0pistils\\xa0and stamens. These flowers are described by botanists as being perfect, bisexual, or\\xa0hermaphrodite. In some species of plants, the flowers are imperfect or unisexual: having only either male (stamens) or female (pistil) parts. If unisexual male and female flowers appear on the same plant, the species is called\\xa0monoecious.[23]\\xa0However, if an individual plant is either female or male, the species is called\\xa0dioecious. Many flowers have\\xa0nectaries, which are glands that produce a sugary fluid used to attract pollinators. They are not considered as an organ on their own.[24]\\n\\nInflorescence\\n\\nMain article:\\xa0Inflorescence\\n\\nThe\\xa0calla lily\\xa0is not a single flower. It is actually an\\xa0inflorescence\\xa0of tiny flowers pressed together on a central stalk that is surrounded by a large petal-like\\xa0bract.[25]\\n\\nIn those species that have more than one flower on an axis, the collective cluster of flowers is called an\\xa0inflorescence. Some inflorescences are composed of many small \\n\\n\\n\\nflowers arranged in a formation that resembles a single flower. A common example of this is most members of the very large composite (Asteraceae) group. A single\\xa0daisy\\xa0or\\xa0sunflower, for example, is not a flower but a flower\\xa0head—an inflorescence composed of numerous flowers (or florets).[26]\\xa0An inflorescence may include specialized stems and modified leaves known as\\xa0bracts.[27]\\n\\nFloral diagrams and formulae\\n\\nMain articles:\\xa0Floral formula\\xa0and\\xa0Floral diagram\\n\\nA\\xa0floral formula\\xa0is a way to represent the structure of a flower using specific letters, numbers, and symbols, presenting substantial information about the flower in a compact form. It can represent a\\xa0taxon, usually giving ranges of the numbers of different organs, or particular species. Floral formulae have been developed in the early 19th century and their use has declined since. Prenner\\xa0et al.\\xa0(2010) devised an extension of the existing model to broaden the descriptive capability of the formula.[28]\\xa0The format of floral formulae differs in different parts of the world, yet they convey the same information.[29][30][31][32]\\n\\nThe structure of a flower can also be expressed by the means of\\xa0floral diagrams. The use of schematic diagrams can replace long descriptions or complicated drawings as a tool for understanding both floral structure and evolution. Such diagrams may show important features of flowers, including the relative positions of the various organs, including the presence of fusion and symmetry, as well as structural details.[33]\\n\\nDevelopment\\n\\nA flower develops on a modified shoot or\\xa0axis\\xa0from a determinate apical\\xa0meristem\\xa0(determinate\\xa0meaning the axis grows to a set size). It has compressed internodes, bearing structures that in classical plant morphology are interpreted as highly modified\\xa0leaves.[34]\\xa0Detailed developmental studies, however, have shown that stamens are often initiated more or less like\\xa0modified stems\\xa0(caulomes) that in some cases may even resemble\\xa0branchlets.[35][16]\\xa0Taking into account the whole diversity in the development of the androecium of flowering plants, we find a continuum between modified leaves (phyllomes), modified stems (caulomes), and modified branchlets (shoots).[36][37]\\n\\nTransition\\n\\nThe transition to flowering is one of the major phase changes that a plant makes during its life cycle. The transition must take place at a time that is favorable for\\xa0fertilization\\xa0and the formation of\\xa0seeds, hence ensuring maximal\\xa0reproductive\\xa0success. To meet these needs a plant is able to interpret important endogenous and environmental cues such as changes in levels of\\xa0plant hormones\\xa0and seasonable\\xa0temperature\\xa0and\\xa0photoperiod\\xa0changes.[38]\\xa0Many\\xa0perennial\\xa0and most\\xa0biennial\\xa0plants require\\xa0vernalization\\xa0to flower. The molecular interpretation of these signals is through the transmission of a complex signal known as\\xa0florigen, which involves a variety of\\xa0genes, including Constans, Flowering Locus C, and Flowering Locus T. Florigen is produced in the leaves in reproductively favorable conditions and acts in\\xa0buds\\xa0and growing tips to induce a number of different physiological and morphological changes.[39]\\n\\n\\n\\nThe ABC model of flower development\\n\\nThe first step of the transition is the transformation of the vegetative stem primordia into floral primordia. This occurs as biochemical changes take place to change cellular differentiation of leaf, bud and stem tissues into tissue that will grow into the reproductive organs. Growth of the central part of the stem tip stops or flattens out and the sides develop protuberances in a whorled or spiral fashion around the outside of the stem end. These protuberances develop into the sepals, petals, stamens, and\\xa0carpels. Once this process begins, in most plants, it cannot be reversed and the stems develop flowers, even if the initial start of the flower formation event was dependent of some environmental cue.[40]\\n\\nOrgan development\\n\\nMain article:\\xa0ABC model of flower development\\n\\nThe ABC model is a simple model that describes the\\xa0genes\\xa0responsible for the development of flowers. Three gene activities interact in a combinatorial manner to determine the developmental identities of the\\xa0primordia\\xa0organ within the floral\\xa0apical meristem. These gene functions are called A, B, and C. A genes are expressed in only outer and lower most section of the apical meristem, which becomes a whorl of sepals. In the second whorl both A and B genes are expressed, leading to the formation of petals. In the third whorl, B and C genes interact to form stamens and in the center of the flower C genes alone give rise to carpels. The model is based upon studies of aberrant flowers and mutations in\\xa0Arabidopsis thaliana\\xa0and the snapdragon,\\xa0Antirrhinum majus. For example, when there is a loss of B gene function, mutant flowers are produced with sepals in the first whorl as usual, but also in the second whorl instead of the normal petal formation. In the third whorl the lack of B function but presence of C function mimics the fourth whorl, leading to the formation of carpels also in the third whorl.[41]\\n\\nFunction\\n\\nSee also:\\xa0Plant reproductive morphology\\n\\nThe principal purpose of a flower is the reproduction[42]\\xa0of the individual and the species. All flowering plants are\\xa0heterosporous, that is, every individual plant produces two types of\\xa0spores. Microspores are produced by\\xa0meiosis\\xa0inside anthers and megaspores are produced inside ovules that are within an ovary. Anthers typically consist of four microsporangia and an ovule is an integumented megasporangium. Both types of spores develop into\\xa0gametophytes\\xa0inside sporangia. \\n\\n\\n\\nAs with all heterosporous plants, the gametophytes also develop inside the spores, i. e., they are endosporic.\\n\\nPollination\\n\\nMain article:\\xa0Pollination\\n\\nGrains of pollen sticking to this bee will be transferred to the next flower it visits.\\n\\nSince the flowers are the reproductive organs of the plant, they mediate the joining of the sperm, contained within pollen, to the ovules — contained in the ovary.[10]\\xa0Pollination is the movement of pollen from the anthers to the stigma.[43]\\xa0Normally pollen is moved from one plant to another, known as\\xa0cross-pollination, but many plants are able to self-pollinate. Cross-pollination is preferred because it allows for\\xa0genetic variation, which contributes to the survival of the species.[44]\\xa0Many flowers depend on external factors for pollination, such as: the wind, water, animals, and especially\\xa0insects. Larger animals such as birds, bats, and even some\\xa0pygmy possums,[45]\\xa0however, can also be employed.[46][47]\\xa0To accomplish this, flowers have specific designs which encourage the transfer of pollen from one plant to another of the same species. The period of time during which this process can take place (when the flower is fully expanded and functional) is called\\xa0anthesis,[48]\\xa0hence the study of pollination biology is called\\xa0anthecology.[49]\\n\\nFlowering plants usually face\\xa0evolutionary pressure\\xa0to optimize the transfer of their\\xa0pollen, and this is typically reflected in the morphology of the flowers and the behavior of the plants.[50]\\xa0Pollen may be transferred between plants via a number of \\'vectors,\\' or methods. Around 80% of flowering plants make use of biotic, or living vectors. Others use abiotic, or non-living, vectors and some plants make use of multiple vectors, but most are highly specialised.[51]\\n\\nThough some fit between or outside of these groups,[52]\\xa0most flowers can be divided between the following two broad groups of pollination methods:\\n\\nBiotic pollination\\n\\nFlowers that use biotic vectors attract and use\\xa0insects,\\xa0bats,\\xa0birds, or other animals to transfer pollen from one flower to the next. Often they are\\xa0specialized\\xa0in shape and have an arrangement of the stamens that ensures that pollen grains are transferred to the bodies of the pollinator when it lands in search of its attractant (such as nectar, pollen, or a mate).[53]\\xa0In pursuing this attractant from many flowers of the same species, the pollinator transfers pollen to the stigmas—arranged with equally pointed precision—of all of the flowers it visits.[54]\\xa0Many flowers rely on simple proximity between flower parts to ensure pollination, while others have elaborate designs to ensure pollination and prevent\\xa0self-pollination.[44]\\xa0Flowers use animals \\n\\n\\n\\nincluding: insects (entomophily), birds (ornithophily), bats (chiropterophily), lizards,[47]\\xa0and even snails and slugs (malacophilae).[55]\\n\\nAttraction methods\\n\\nOphrys apifera, a bee orchid, which has evolved over many generations to mimic a female bee.[56]\\n\\nPlants cannot move from one location to another, thus many flowers have evolved to attract animals to transfer pollen between individuals in dispersed populations. Most commonly, flowers are insect-pollinated, known as\\xa0entomophilous; literally \"insect-loving\" in Greek.[57]\\xa0To attract these insects flowers commonly have glands called\\xa0nectaries\\xa0on various parts that attract animals looking for nutritious\\xa0nectar.[58]\\xa0Some flowers have glands called\\xa0elaiophores, which produce oils rather than nectar.[59]\\xa0Birds and bees have\\xa0color vision, enabling them to seek out colorful flowers.[60]\\xa0Some flowers have patterns, called\\xa0nectar guides, that show pollinators where to look for nectar; they may be visible only under\\xa0ultraviolet\\xa0light, which is visible to bees and some other insects.[61]\\n\\nFlowers also attract pollinators by\\xa0scent, though not all flower scents are appealing to humans; a number of flowers are pollinated by insects that are attracted to rotten flesh and have flowers that smell like dead animals. These are often called\\xa0Carrion flowers, including plants in the genus\\xa0Rafflesia, and the\\xa0titan arum.[60]\\xa0Flowers pollinated by night visitors, including bats and moths, are likely to concentrate on scent to attract pollinators and so most such flowers are white.[62]\\xa0Some plants pollinated by bats have a sonar-reflecting petal above its flowers, which helps the bat find them,[63]\\xa0and one species, the cactus\\xa0Espostoa frutescens, has flowers that are surrounded by an area of sound-absorbent and wooly hairs called the cephalium, which absorbs the bat\\'s ultrasound instead.[64]\\n\\nFlowers are also specialized in shape and have an arrangement of the\\xa0stamens\\xa0that ensures that pollen grains are transferred to the bodies of the pollinator when it lands in search of its attractant. Other flowers use mimicry or\\xa0pseudocopulation\\xa0to attract pollinators. Many orchids for example, produce flowers resembling female bees or wasps in colour, shape, and scent. Males move from one flower to the next in search of a mate, pollinating the flowers.[65][66]\\n\\nPollinator relationships\\n\\nFurther information:\\xa0Pollination syndrome\\n\\n\\n\\nMany flowers have close relationships with one or a few specific pollinating organisms. Many flowers, for example, attract only one specific species of insect, and therefore rely on that insect for successful reproduction. This close relationship an example of\\xa0coevolution, as the flower and pollinator have developed together over a long period of time to match each other\\'s needs.[67]\\xa0This close relationship compounds the negative effects of\\xa0extinction, however, since the extinction of either member in such a relationship would almost certainly mean the extinction of the other member as well.[68]\\n\\nAbiotic pollination\\n\\nMain articles:\\xa0Anemophily\\xa0and\\xa0Hydrophily\\n\\nA Grass flower with its long, thin filaments and large feathery stigma.\\n\\nThe female flower of\\xa0Enhalus acoroides, which is pollinated through a combination of Hyphydrogamy and Ephydrogamy.\\n\\nFlowers that use abiotic, or non-living, vectors use the\\xa0wind\\xa0or, much less commonly,\\xa0water, to move pollen from one flower to the next.[51]\\xa0In wind-dispersed (anemophilous) species, the tiny pollen grains are carried, sometimes many thousands of kilometres,[69]\\xa0by the wind to other flowers. Common examples include the\\xa0grasses,\\xa0birch trees, along with many other species in the order\\xa0Fagales,[70]\\xa0ragweeds, and many\\xa0sedges. They have no need to attract pollinators and therefore tend not to grow large, showy, or colorful flowers, and do not have nectaries, nor a noticeable scent. Because of this, plants typically have many thousands of tiny flowers which have comparatively large, feathery stigmas; to increase the chance of pollen being received.[65]\\xa0Whereas the pollen of entomophilous flowers is usually large, sticky, and rich in\\xa0protein\\xa0(to act as a \"reward\" for pollinators), anemophilous flower pollen is typically small-grained, very light, smooth, and of little nutritional value to\\xa0insects.[71][72]\\xa0In order for the wind to effectively pick up and transport the pollen, the flowers typically have anthers loosely attached to the end of long thin filaments, or pollen forms around a\\xa0catkin\\xa0which moves in the wind. Rarer forms of this involve individual flowers being moveable by the wind (Pendulous), or even less commonly; the anthers exploding to release the pollen into the wind.[71]\\n\\n\\n\\nPollination through water (hydrophily) is a much rarer method, occurring in only around 2% of abiotically pollinated flowers.[51]\\xa0Common examples of this include\\xa0Calitriche autumnalis,\\xa0Vallisneria spiralis\\xa0and some\\xa0sea-grasses. One characteristic which most species in this group share is a lack of an\\xa0exine, or protective layer, around the pollen grain.[73]\\xa0Paul Knuth identified two types of hydrophilous pollination in 1906 and Ernst Schwarzenbach added a third in 1944. Knuth named his two groups \\'Hyphydrogamy\\' and the more common \\'Ephydrogamy.\\'[74]\\xa0In hyphydrogamy pollination occurs below the surface of the water and so the pollen grains are typically negatively\\xa0buoyant. For marine plants that exhibit this method the stigmas are usually stiff, while freshwater species have small and feathery stigmas.[75]\\xa0In ephydrogamy pollination occurs on the surface of the water and so the pollen has a low density to enable floating, though many also use rafts, and are\\xa0hydrophobic. Marine flowers have floating thread-like stigmas and may have adaptations for the tide, while freshwater species create indentations in the water.[75]\\xa0The third category, set out by Schwarzenbach, is those flowers which transport pollen above the water through conveyance. This ranges from floating plants, (Lemnoideae), to\\xa0staminate\\xa0flowers (Vallisneria). Most species in this group have dry, spherical pollen which sometimes forms into larger masses, and female flowers which form depressions in the water; the method of transport varies.[75]\\n\\nMechanisms\\n\\nFlowers can be pollinated by two mechanisms; cross-pollination and self-pollination. No mechanism is indisputably better than the other as they each have their advantages and disadvantages. Plants use one or both of these mechanisms depending on their\\xa0habitat\\xa0and\\xa0ecological niche.[76]\\n\\nCross-pollination\\n\\nCross-pollination is the pollination of the carpel by pollen from a different plant of the same species. Because the genetic make-up of the sperm contained within the pollen from the other plant is different, their combination will result in a new, genetically distinct, plant, through the process of\\xa0sexual reproduction. Since each new plant is genetically distinct, the different plants show\\xa0variation\\xa0in their physiological and structural adaptations and so the\\xa0population\\xa0as a whole is better prepared for an adverse occurrence in the environment. Cross-pollination, therefore, increases the survival of the species and is usually preferred by flowers for this reason.[44][77]\\n\\nSelf-pollination\\n\\nClianthus puniceus, the Kaka Beak.\\n\\nSelf-pollination is the pollination of the carpel of a flower by pollen from either the same flower or another flower on the same plant,[44]\\xa0leading to the creation of a genetic clone through\\xa0asexual reproduction. This increases the reliability of \\n\\n\\n\\nproducing seeds, the rate at which they can be produced, and lowers the amount energy needed.[78]\\xa0But, most importantly, it limits\\xa0genetic variation. In addition, self-pollination causes\\xa0inbreeding depression, due largely to the expression of recessive deleterious\\xa0mutations.[79][80]\\n\\nThe extreme case of self-fertilization, when the ovule is fertilized by pollen from the same flower or plant, occurs in flowers that always self-fertilize, such as many\\xa0dandelions.[81]\\xa0Some flowers are self-pollinated and have flowers that never open or are self-pollinated before the flowers open; these flowers are called\\xa0cleistogamous; many species in the genus\\xa0Viola\\xa0exhibit this, for example.[82]\\n\\nConversely, many species of plants have ways of preventing self-pollination and hence, self-fertilization. Unisexual male and female flowers on the same plant may not appear or mature at the same time, or pollen from the same plant may be incapable of fertilizing its ovules. The latter flower types, which have chemical barriers to their own pollen, are referred to as self-incompatible.[23][83]\\xa0In\\xa0Clianthus puniceus, (pictured), self-pollination is used strategically as an \"insurance policy.\" When a pollinator, in this case a bird, visits\\xa0C. puniceus\\xa0it rubs off the stigmatic covering and allows for pollen from the bird to enter the stigma. If no pollinators visit, however, then the stigmatic covering falls off naturally to allow for the flower\\'s own anthers to pollinate the flower through self-pollination.[78]\\n\\nAllergies\\n\\nMain article:\\xa0Pollen allergy\\n\\nPollen is a large contributor to\\xa0asthma\\xa0and other\\xa0respiratory allergies\\xa0which combined affect between 10 and 50% of people worldwide. This number appears to be growing, as the temperature increases due to\\xa0climate change\\xa0mean that plants are producing more pollen[citation needed], which is also more allergenic. Pollen is difficult to avoid, however, because of its small size and prevalence in the natural environment. Most of the pollen which causes allergies is that produced by wind-dispersed pollinators such as the\\xa0grasses,\\xa0birch trees,\\xa0oak\\xa0trees, and\\xa0ragweeds; the allergens in pollen are proteins which are thought to be necessary in the process of pollination.[84][85]\\n\\nFertilization\\n\\nMain articles:\\xa0Fertilization\\xa0and\\xa0Double fertilization\\n\\nA floral diagram, with the pollen tube labelled\\xa0PG\\n\\nFertilization, also called\\xa0Synagmy,\\xa0occurs following pollination, which is the movement of pollen from the stamen to the carpel. It encompasses \\n\\n\\n\\nboth\\xa0plasmogamy, the fusion of the\\xa0protoplasts, and\\xa0karyogamy, the fusion of the\\xa0nuclei. When pollen lands on the stigma of the flower it begins creating a\\xa0pollen tube\\xa0which runs down through the style and into the ovary. After penetrating the centre-most part of the ovary it enters the egg apparatus and into one\\xa0synergid. At this point the end of the pollen tube bursts and releases the two sperm cells, one of which makes its way to an egg, while also losing its\\xa0cell membrane\\xa0and much of its\\xa0protoplasm. The sperm\\'s nucleus then fuses with the egg\\'s nucleus, resulting in the formation of a\\xa0zygote, a\\xa0diploid\\xa0(two copies of each\\xa0chromosome) cell.[86]\\n\\nWhereas in fertilization only plasmogamy, or the fusion of the whole sex cells, results, in Angiosperms (flowering plants) a process known as double fertilization, which involves both karyogamy and plasmogamy, occurs. In double fertilization the second sperm cell subsequently also enters the synergid and fuses with the two polar nuclei of the central cell. Since all three nuclei are\\xa0haploid, they result in a large\\xa0endosperm\\xa0nucleus which is\\xa0triploid.[86]\\n\\nSeed development\\n\\nMain article:\\xa0Seed development\\n\\nThe fruit of a peach with the seed or stone inside.\\n\\nFollowing the formation of zygote it begins to grow through nuclear and cellular divisions, called\\xa0mitosis, eventually becoming a small group of cells. One section of it becomes the\\xa0embryo, while the other becomes the suspensor; a structure which forces the embryo into the\\xa0endosperm\\xa0and is later undetectable. Two small\\xa0primordia\\xa0also form at this time, that later become the\\xa0cotyledon, which is used as an energy store. Plants which grow out one of these primordia are called\\xa0monocotyledons, while those that grow out two are\\xa0dicotyledons. The next stage is called the Torpedo stage and involves the growth of several key structures, including: the\\xa0radicle\\xa0(embryotic root), the\\xa0epicotyl\\xa0(embryotic stem), and the\\xa0hypocotyl, (the root/shoot junction). In the final step\\xa0vascular tissue\\xa0develops around the seed.[87]\\n\\nFruit development\\n\\nMain article:\\xa0Fruit §\\xa0Development\\n\\nThe ovary, inside which the seed is forming from the ovule, grows into a\\xa0fruit. All the other main floral parts die during this development, including: the style, stigma, sepals, stamens, and petals. The fruit contains three structures: the\\xa0exocarp, or outer layer, the\\xa0mesocarp, or the fleshy part, and the\\xa0endocarp, or innermost layer, while the fruit wall is called the\\xa0pericarp. The size, shape, toughness, and thickness varies among different fruit. This is because it is directly connected to the method of seed dispersal; that being the purpose of fruit - to encourage or enable the seed\\'s dispersal and protect the seed while doing so.[87]\\n\\n\\n\\nSeed dispersal\\n\\nMain articles:\\xa0Biological dispersal\\xa0and\\xa0Seed dispersal\\n\\nThe kererū,\\xa0Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae, is an important disperser of seeds in New Zealand.[88]\\n\\nA\\xa0samara\\xa0from a\\xa0maple tree\\xa0with its distinctive \"wings.\"[89]\\n\\nAcaena novae-zelandiae\\xa0uses\\xa0Epizoochory\\xa0to disperse its seeds.[90]\\n\\nFollowing the pollination of a flower, fertilization, and finally the development of a seed and fruit, a mechanism is typically used to disperse the fruit away from the plant.[91]\\xa0In Angiosperms (flowering plants) seeds are dispersed away from the plant so as to not force competition between the mother and the daughter plants,[92]\\xa0as well as to enable the colonisation of new areas. They are often divided into two categories, though many plants fall in between or in one or more of these:[93]\\n\\nAllochory\\n\\nIn allochory, plants use an external\\xa0vector, or carrier, to transport their seeds away from them. These can be either\\xa0biotic\\xa0(living), such as by birds and ants, or\\xa0abiotic\\xa0(non-living), such as by the wind or water.[93][94][95]\\n\\nBiotic vectors\\n\\nMain article:\\xa0Seed dispersal §\\xa0Animals: epi- and endozoochory\\n\\nMany plants use biotic vectors to disperse their seeds away from them. This method falls under the umbrella term\\xa0Zoochory,\\xa0while\\xa0Endozoochory,\\xa0also known as\\xa0fruigivory,\\xa0refers specifically to plants adapted to grow fruit in order to attract animals to eat them. Once eaten they go through typically go through animal\\'s digestive system and are dispersed away from the plant.[95]\\xa0Some seeds are specially \\n\\n\\n\\nadapted either to last in the\\xa0gizzard\\xa0of animals or even to germinate better after passing through them.[96][97]\\xa0They can be eaten by birds (ornithochory), bats (chiropterochory),\\xa0rodents, primates, ants (myrmecochory),[98]\\xa0non-bird sauropsids (saurochory), mammals in general\\xa0(mammaliochory),[96]\\xa0and even\\xa0fish.[99]\\xa0Typically their fruit are fleshy, have a high nutritional value, and may have chemical attractants as an additional \"reward\" for dispersers. This is reflected\\xa0morphologically\\xa0in the presence of more\\xa0pulp, an\\xa0aril, and sometimes an\\xa0elaiosome\\xa0(primarily for ants), which are other fleshy structures.[100]\\n\\nEpizoochory\\xa0occurs in plants whose seeds are adapted to cling on to animals and be dispersed that way, such as many species in the genus\\xa0Acaena.[101]\\xa0Typically these plants seed\\'s have hooks or a\\xa0viscous\\xa0surface to easier grip to animals, which include birds and animals with\\xa0fur. Some plants use\\xa0mimesis, or imitation, to trick animals into dispersing the seeds and these often have specially adapted colors.[100][102]\\n\\nThe final type of\\xa0Zoochory\\xa0is called\\xa0Synzoochory,\\xa0which involves neither the digestion of the seeds, nor the unintentional carrying of the seed on the body, but the deliberate carrying of the seeds by the animals. This is usually in the mouth or\\xa0beak\\xa0of the animal (called\\xa0Stomatochory), which is what is used for many birds and all ants.[103]\\n\\nThe lichen\\xa0Usnea angulata, which uses\\xa0hydrochory, is a weed in\\xa0New Zealand.[104]\\n\\nHura crepitans\\xa0disperses its seeds ballistically and is hence commonly called the \"dynamite tree.\"[105]\\n\\nAbiotic vectors\\n\\nMain articles:\\xa0Anemochory\\xa0and\\xa0Seed dispersal §\\xa0Water\\n\\nIn abiotic dispersal plants use the vectors of the wind, water, or a mechanism of their own to transport their seeds away from them.[95][94]\\xa0Anemochory\\xa0involves using the wind as a vector to disperse plant\\'s seeds. Because these seeds have to travel in the wind they are almost always small - sometimes even dust-like, have a high\\xa0surface-area-to-volume ratio, and are produced in a large number - sometimes up to a million. Plants such as\\xa0tumbleweeds\\xa0detach the entire shoot to let the seeds roll away with the wind. Another common adaptation are wings, plumes or balloon like structures that let the seeds stay in the air for longer and hence travel farther.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn\\xa0Hydrochory\\xa0plants are adapted to disperse their seeds through bodies of water and so typically are buoyant and have a low\\xa0relative density\\xa0with regards to the water. Commonly seeds are adapted morphologically with hydrophobic surfaces, small size, hairs, slime,\\xa0oil, and sometimes air spaces within the seeds.[100]\\xa0These plants fall into three categories: ones where seeds are dispersed on the surface of water currents, under the surface of water currents, and by rain landing on a plant.[104]\\n\\nAutochory\\n\\nMain article:\\xa0Autochory\\n\\nIn\\xa0autochory, plants create their own vectors to transport the seeds away from them. Adaptations for this usually involve the fruits exploding and forcing the seeds away\\xa0ballistically, such as in\\xa0Hura crepitans,[105]\\xa0or sometimes in the creation of creeping\\xa0diaspores.[100]\\xa0Because of the relatively small distances that these methods can disperse their seeds, they are often paired with an external vector.[102]\\n\\nEvolution\\n\\nFurther information:\\xa0Evolution of flowers\\xa0and\\xa0Floral biology\\n\\nWhile land plants have existed for about 425 million years, the first ones\\xa0reproduced\\xa0by a simple adaptation of their aquatic counterparts:\\xa0spores. In the sea, plants—and some animals—can simply scatter out genetic\\xa0clones\\xa0of themselves to float away and grow elsewhere. This is how early plants reproduced. But plants soon evolved methods of protecting these copies to deal with drying out and other damage which is even more likely on land than in the sea. The protection became the\\xa0seed, though it had not yet evolved the flower. Early seed-bearing plants include the\\xa0ginkgo\\xa0and\\xa0conifers.\\n\\nArchaefructus\\xa0liaoningensis, one of the earliest known flowering plants\\n\\nSeveral groups of extinct\\xa0gymnosperms, particularly\\xa0seed ferns, have been proposed as the ancestors of flowering plants but there is no continuous fossil evidence showing exactly how flowers evolved. The apparently sudden appearance of relatively modern flowers in the fossil record posed such a problem for the theory of evolution that it was called an \"abominable mystery\" by\\xa0Charles Darwin.\\n\\nRecently discovered angiosperm fossils such as\\xa0Archaefructus, along with further discoveries of fossil gymnosperms, suggest how angiosperm characteristics may have been acquired in a series of steps. An early fossil of a flowering plant,\\xa0Archaefructus\\xa0liaoningensis\\xa0from China, is dated about 125 million years old.[106][107]\\xa0Even earlier from China is the 125–130 million years old\\xa0Archaefructus\\xa0sinensis. In 2015 a plant (130 million-year-old\\xa0Montsechia vidalii, discovered in Spain) was claimed to be 130 million years old.[108]\\xa0In 2018, scientists reported that the earliest flowers began about 180 million years ago.[109]\\n\\n\\n\\nAmborella trichopoda\\xa0may have characteristic features of the earliest flowering plants\\n\\nRecent\\xa0DNA\\xa0analysis (molecular systematics)[110]\\xa0shows that\\xa0Amborella trichopoda, found on the Pacific island of New Caledonia, is the only species in the\\xa0sister group\\xa0to the rest of the flowering plants, and morphological studies suggest that it has features which may have been characteristic of the earliest flowering plants.[111]\\n\\nBesides the hard proof of flowers in or shortly before the\\xa0Cretaceous,[112][113]\\xa0there is some circumstantial evidence of flowers as much as 250 million years ago. A chemical used by plants to defend their flowers,\\xa0oleanane, has been detected in fossil plants that old, including\\xa0gigantopterids,[114]\\xa0which evolved at that time and bear many of the traits of modern, flowering plants, though they are not known to be flowering plants themselves, because only their stems and prickles have been found preserved in detail; one of the earliest examples of\\xa0petrification.\\n\\nThe similarity in\\xa0leaf\\xa0and\\xa0stem\\xa0structure can be very important, because flowers are genetically just an adaptation of normal leaf and stem components on plants, a combination of genes normally responsible for forming new shoots.[115]\\xa0The most primitive flowers are thought to have had a variable number of flower parts, often separate from (but in contact with) each other. The flowers would have tended to grow in a spiral pattern, to be\\xa0bisexual\\xa0(in plants, this means both male and female parts on the same flower), and to be dominated by the\\xa0ovary\\xa0(female part). As flowers grew more advanced, some variations developed parts fused together, with a much more specific number and design, and with either specific sexes per flower or plant, or at least \"ovary inferior\".\\n\\nThe general assumption is that the function of flowers, from the start, was to involve animals in the reproduction process. Pollen can be scattered without bright colors and obvious shapes, which would therefore be a liability, using the plant\\'s resources, unless they provide some other benefit. One proposed reason for the sudden, fully developed appearance of flowers is that they evolved in an isolated setting like an island, or chain of islands, where the plants bearing them were able to develop a highly specialized relationship with some specific animal (a wasp, for example), the way many island species develop today. This symbiotic relationship, with a hypothetical wasp bearing pollen from one plant to another much the way\\xa0fig wasps\\xa0do today, could have eventually resulted in both the plant(s) and their partners developing a high degree of specialization.\\xa0Island genetics\\xa0is believed to be a common source of\\xa0speciation, especially when it comes to radical adaptations which seem to have required inferior transitional forms. Note that the wasp example is not incidental; bees, apparently evolved specifically for symbiotic plant relationships, are descended from wasps.\\n\\n\\n\\nLikewise, most\\xa0fruit\\xa0used in plant reproduction comes from the enlargement of parts of the flower. This fruit is frequently a tool which depends upon animals wishing to eat it, and thus scattering the seeds it contains.\\n\\nWhile many such\\xa0symbiotic relationships\\xa0remain too fragile to survive competition with mainland organisms, flowers proved to be an unusually effective means of production, spreading (whatever their actual origin) to become the dominant form of land plant life.\\n\\nFlower evolution continues to the present day; modern flowers have been so profoundly influenced by humans that many of them cannot be pollinated in nature. Many modern, domesticated flowers used to be simple weeds, which only sprouted when the ground was disturbed. Some of them tended to grow with human crops, and the prettiest did not get plucked because of their beauty, developing a dependence upon and special adaptation to human affection.[116]\\n\\nColour\\n\\nSee also:\\xa0Color garden\\n\\nReflectance spectra for the flowers of several varieties of\\xa0rose. A red rose absorbs about 99.7% of light across a broad area below the red wavelengths of the spectrum, leading to an exceptionally\\xa0pure\\xa0red. A yellow rose will reflect about 5% of blue light, producing an unsaturated yellow (a yellow with a degree of white in it).\\n\\nMany flowering plants reflect as much\\xa0light\\xa0as possible within the range of visible\\xa0wavelengths\\xa0of the pollinator the plant intends to attract. Flowers that reflect the full range of visible light are generally perceived as\\xa0white\\xa0by a human observer. An important feature of white flowers is that they reflect equally across the visible spectrum. While many flowering plants use white to attract pollinators, the use of color is also widespread (even within the same species). Color allows a flowering plant to be more specific about the pollinator it seeks to attract.[citation needed]\\xa0The color model used by human color reproduction technology (CMYK) relies on the modulation of pigments that divide the spectrum into broad areas of absorption. Flowering plants by contrast are able to shift the transition point wavelength between absorption and reflection. If it is assumed that the visual systems of most pollinators view the visible spectrum as\\xa0circular\\xa0then it may be said that flowering plants produce color by absorbing the light in one region of the spectrum and reflecting the light in the other region. With CMYK, color is produced as a function of the amplitude of the broad regions of absorption. Flowering plants by contrast produce color by modifying the frequency (or rather wavelength) of the light reflected. Most flowers absorb light in the blue to yellow region of the spectrum and reflect light from the green to red region of the spectrum. For many species of flowering plant, it is the transition point that characterizes the color that they produce. Color may be modulated by shifting the transition point between absorption and reflection and in this way a flowering plant may specify which pollinator it seeks to attract.[citation needed\\n\\n\\n\\n]\\xa0Some flowering plants also have a limited ability to modulate areas of absorption. This is typically not as precise as control over wavelength. Humans observers will perceive this as degrees of\\xa0saturation\\xa0(the amount of\\xa0white\\xa0in the color).\\n\\nClassical taxonomy\\n\\nMain articles:\\xa0Linnaean taxonomy\\xa0and\\xa0Plant taxonomy\\n\\nCarl Linnaeus\\'s method for classifying plants focused solely on the structure and nature of the flowers.[117]\\n\\nIn\\xa0plant taxonomy, which is the study of the classification and identification of plants, the\\xa0morphology\\xa0of plant\\'s flowers are used extensively – and have been for thousands of years. Although the history of plant taxonomy extends back to at least around 300\\xa0B.C.\\xa0with the writings of\\xa0Theophrastus,[118]\\xa0the foundation of the modern science is based on works in the 18th and 19th centuries.[119]\\n\\nCarl Linnaeus\\xa0(1707–1778), was a Swedish botanist who spent most of his working life as a professor of natural history. His landmark 1757 book\\xa0Species Plantarum\\xa0lays out his system of classification as well as the concept of\\xa0binomial nomenclature, the latter of which is still used around the world today.[119][note 1]\\xa0He identified 24 classes, based mainly on the number, length and union of the\\xa0stamens. The first ten classes follow the number of stamens directly (Octandria\\xa0have 8 stamens etc.),[117]\\xa0while class eleven has 11–20 stamens and classes twelve and thirteen have 20 stamens; differing only in their point of attachment. The next five classes deal with the length of the stamens and the final five with the nature of the reproductive capability of the plant; where the stamen grows; and if the flower is concealed or exists at all (such as in\\xa0ferns). This method of classification, despite being artificial,[117]\\xa0was used extensively for the following seven decades, before being replaced by the system of another botanist.[120]\\n\\nAntoine Laurent de Jussieu\\xa0(1748–1836) was a French botanist whose 1787 work\\xa0Genera plantarum: secundum ordines naturales disposita\\xa0set out a new method for classifying plants; based instead on natural characteristics. Plants were divided by the number, if any, of\\xa0cotyledons, and the location of the stamens.[120]\\xa0The next most major system of classification came in the late 19th century from the botanists\\xa0Joseph Dalton Hooker\\xa0(1817–1911) and\\xa0George Bentham\\xa0(1800–1884). They built on the earlier works of de Jussieu and\\xa0Augustin Pyramus de Candolle\\xa0and devised a system which is still used in many of the world\\'s\\xa0herbaria. Plants were divided at the highest level by the number of cotyledons and the nature of the \\n\\n\\n\\nflowers, before falling into orders (families),\\xa0genera, and\\xa0species. This system of classification was published in their\\xa0Genera plantarum\\xa0in three volumes between 1862 and 1883.[121]\\xa0It is the most highly regarded and deemed the \"best system of classification,\" in some settings.[122]\\n\\nFollowing the development in scientific thought after Darwin\\'s\\xa0On the Origin of Species, many botanists have used more\\xa0phylogenetic\\xa0methods and the use of\\xa0genetic sequencing,\\xa0cytology, and\\xa0palynology\\xa0has become increasingly common. Despite this,\\xa0morphological\\xa0characteristics such as the nature of the flower and\\xa0inflorescence\\xa0still make up the bedrock of plant taxonomy.[122][123]\\n\\nSymbolism\\n\\nLilies\\xa0are often used to denote life or resurrection\\n\\nMain article:\\xa0Language of flowers\\n\\nMany flowers have important\\xa0symbolic\\xa0meanings in Western culture.[124]\\xa0The practice of assigning meanings to flowers is known as\\xa0floriography. Some of the more common examples include:\\n\\nRed\\xa0roses\\xa0are given as a symbol of love, beauty, and passion.[125]\\n\\nPoppies\\xa0are a symbol of consolation in time of death. In the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia and Canada,\\xa0red poppies\\xa0are worn to commemorate soldiers who have died in times of war.\\n\\nIrises/Lily\\xa0are used in burials as a symbol referring to \"resurrection/life\". It is also associated with stars (sun) and its petals blooming/shining.\\n\\nDaisies\\xa0are a symbol of innocence.\\n\\nFlowers are common subjects of\\xa0still life\\xa0paintings, such as this one by\\xa0Ambrosius Bosschaert the Elder\\n\\nBecause of their varied and colorful appearance, flowers have long been a favorite subject of visual artists as well. Some of the most celebrated paintings from well-known painters are of flowers, such as\\xa0Van Gogh\\'s\\xa0sunflowers\\xa0series or\\xa0Monet\\'s \\n\\n\\n\\nwater lilies. Flowers are also dried, freeze dried and pressed in order to create permanent, three-dimensional pieces of\\xa0floral art.\\n\\nFlowers within art are also representative of the\\xa0female genitalia,[126]\\xa0as seen in the works of artists such as\\xa0Georgia O\\'Keeffe,\\xa0Imogen Cunningham,\\xa0Veronica Ruiz de Velasco, and\\xa0Judy Chicago, and in fact in Asian and western classical art. Many cultures around the world have a marked tendency to associate flowers with\\xa0femininity.\\n\\nThe great variety of delicate and beautiful flowers has inspired the works of numerous poets, especially from the 18th–19th century\\xa0Romantic\\xa0era. Famous examples include\\xa0William Wordsworth\\'s\\xa0I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud\\xa0and\\xa0William Blake\\'s\\xa0Ah! Sun-Flower.\\n\\nTheir symbolism in dreams has also been discussed, with possible interpretations including \"blossoming potential\".[127]\\n\\nThe Roman goddess of flowers, gardens, and the season of Spring is\\xa0Flora. The Greek goddess of spring, flowers and nature is\\xa0Chloris.\\n\\nIn\\xa0Hindu\\xa0mythology, flowers have a significant status. Vishnu, one of the three major gods in the Hindu system, is often depicted standing straight on a\\xa0lotus flower.[128]\\xa0Apart from the association with Vishnu, the Hindu tradition also considers the lotus to have spiritual significance.[129]\\xa0For example, it figures in the Hindu stories of creation.[130]\\n\\nHuman use\\n\\nThis section\\xa0needs additional citations for\\xa0verification.\\xa0Please help\\xa0improve this article\\xa0by\\xa0adding citations to reliable sources\\xa0in this section.
